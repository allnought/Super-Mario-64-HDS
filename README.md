# Super-Mario-64-HDS
## Description
### Overview
Super Mario 64 HDS is a mod for Super Mario 64 (The PC Port Specifically) it's one that imports and upscales Mario 64 DS textures by a factor of 16, it's kind of a mix between the Cleaner Aesthetics and the RESRGAN 16x re-upscale texturepacks. Not a lot of it is done yet, but it should be in a semi-playable state, at least.
## Questions
### Why?
This mod is not meant to be a direct competitor to any other mod, the DS textures are the most recent non-classic Super Mario 64 textures, therefore this mod is meant to be used in cases that attempt to remaster or modernize the original game, rather than recreate it as it was intended first by its developers, like Projects like Render96 do.
There are also other projects that do a similar thing in relation to texture design, but I myself was not too fond of them, as I believe many of them modernize it too much sacrificing many kinks and quirks of the original textures that gives them personality.
Generally which textures to use depends on what design you're going for and your personal tastes.
### How complete is this?
Currently when this goes public, most of the first floor is finished, but as it's still very early in production, I would advice to use this over another mod, in order to get a more complete experience.
### How was this made?
Using ESRGan, by mixing a large set of different models in different orders, to see what results were the most appealing, I unfortunately didn't write down what models I used for which textures.
also, image manipulation to tweak results, sometimes I split images into different layers and upscaled them seperately, with some textures I practically had to remake the entire texture to make it work somewhat.
