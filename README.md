## Description
### Overview
Super Mario 64 HDS is a mod for Super Mario 64 (The PC Port Specifically) it's one that imports and upscales Mario 64 DS textures by a factor of 16, it is conceptually sort of a mix between the Cleaner Aesthetics and the RESRGAN 16x re-upscale texturepacks. It's not complete but it's making good progress
## Questions
### Why?
This mod is not meant to be a direct competitor to any other mod, the DS textures are the most recent non-classic Super Mario 64 textures, therefore this mod is meant to be used in cases that attempt to remaster or modernize the original game, rather than recreate it as it was intended first by its developers, like Projects like Render96 do.
There are also other projects that do a similar thing in relation to texture design, but many of them did not fit exactly the same need as this pack does, as I believe some of them modeernize it with another philosophy, sacrificing many kinks and quirks of the original textures that gives them personality.
Generally which textures to use depends on what design you're going for and your personal tastes.
### How complete is this?
It has a portion of the game done where it should be relatively useable, you can alawys check the "Projects" page to see how much progress has been done, using the "Compatability branch you can always use this over other texture packs.
### How was this made?
Using ESRGan, by mixing a large set of different models in different orders, and adjusting them in image editing software to fix issues and artifacts.
