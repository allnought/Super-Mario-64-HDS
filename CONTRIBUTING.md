# Contributing Guide
## Contributing Rules or something
With an influx of interest in this project recently, I decided I'd write this contributing guide. It will not explain everything, but it will go over some basics of the project and how to keep those same things when contributing
### Resolution
The textures in this texture pack have a resolution of the original textures time 16, any contributions should try to follow this, there can be exceptions, like if this resolution still is not high enough resolution for some textures to look good, but it should try and follow this resolution unless there is a specific reason not to.
### What textures to contribute
You can check out the Projects page for a general idea of what textures need to be done, but textures not mentioned in the projects are also fair game.
### Replacing Textures
Textures should not be replaced unless there is ground for belief that the new textures look better.
### When to contribute and when not to contribute
If a texture is heavily artifacted or very hard to upscale in general, it should not be contributed unless it's necessary to completing a certain area, and it is only used minorly.
### Seams
A lot of textures in this pack are already riddled with seams, but before contributing a texture, one should check whether a seam is with the texture itself or with mapping, as texture seams can be more easily fixed than mapping seams
## How to contribute
Textures from the DS version can be extracted using the Super Mario 64 DS Level Editor https://code.google.com/archive/p/sm64dse/
If you're new to upscaling, I would recommend looking at the Gameupscale Wiki https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Main_Page, otherwise, non upscaled textures often look better than upscaled textures and are very much welcome.
You can send your contributions in a pull request.
